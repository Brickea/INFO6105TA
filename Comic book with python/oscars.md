## Screenplay

* Hongji Luo: From a Chinese view, I want to say that the script of the comic book have a very antiquity style. And by looking at the English version, I find that this sutdent try his best to translate the "antiquity style" and "ancient feeling" into English.

## Cinematography

* Xuejiao Dong: The comic book use tech like Tokusatsu. The student photoed the whole story by using a camera, which includes dolls (as actors), a loose-leaf notebook (act as a mountain), beans (act as stone), pins (act as grandma's badge), etc. And the organization of the comic book is also nice. So that's why I choose this comic for Oscars Cinematography.

* Hongyao Tao: The comic book of yours can be used in real business activity. The border, page structure are designed. The pictures have been adjusted so it will not distortion. Very impressive work!

## Male/animal actor

* Monali Patel: Very humorous story and it will reminds you the "Chalk Warfare" in YouTube. And every "Averanger data scientist" plays very well during this comic book.

## Female/animal actor

* Hung-Chih Huang: Retro style photo with suspenseful story. The actor’s acting skills can well reflect the protagonist’s struggle. Moreover, what impressed me is this student's attractive code architecture.
