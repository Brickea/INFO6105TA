## Task

You'll have to make the code blocks work together to write a comic book in PDF format that **consists of three pages of about 20 images each, with text**.

The story needs to be a good story because you'll be graded on **artistic merit**, too!

Then I'll award Oscars to the best stories. The categories will be: screenplay, cinematography, best male/animal actor, best female/animal actor).

All submissions need to be **accompanied by the same story in english**. In other words, your submission will consist to two pdf files, one with dialogue in your language, and one with dialogui in english. The pictures need to be the same.

You need to write your own text. The comic book **needs to be in pdf format** (not an image).

No teamwork on this homework. Individual submissions per student.
